let expression was changed in the grammer [lines 41-43] of lang.scm, such that it gets an arbitrary number of (identifier = expression) between 'let' and 'in'.
its interpretation was invented in lines 61-82 of interp.scm.

In order to run tests, open top.scm an run.

Examples of execution (not using tests) :

> (run "let x=30 in let x=-(x,1) y=-(x,2) in -(x,y)")
(num-val 1)
>
