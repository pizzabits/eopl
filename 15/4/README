Exercise 4.22: So far our languages have been expression-oriented:
the primary syntactic category of interest has been expressions
and we have primarily been interested in their values.
Extend IMPLICIT-REFS's language to model the simple statement-oriented
language whose specification is sketched in pages 122-123.

Be sure to follow the Grammar by writing separate procedures to handle programs,
statements, and expressions.

Declaring, assigning and then printing variables:

(run
   "var x,y;
    {
       x = 3;
       y = 1;
       print x;
       print y
    }")

Declaring, assigning and then printing initialized and uninitialized variables:

(run
   "var x,y;
    {
       x = 3;
       
       print x;
       print y
    }")

Example 1:

(run
   "var x, y;
    {
       x = 3;
       y = 4;

       print +(x,y)
    }")

Example 2:

(run
   "var x,y,z; 
    { 
         x = 3;
         y = 4;
         z = 0;
  
         while not(zero?(x))
         {
             z = +(z,y);
             x = -(x,1)};
             print z
     }")

Example 3:

(run
   "var x;
    {
        x = 3;
        print x;
        var x;
        {
           x = 4;
           print x
        };
        print x
    }"

Similar to Example 4:

(run
   "var f,x;
    {
       f = proc(x) 
          -(x,5);
       x = 3;
       print (f x)
    }")
