Exercise 4.29: Add arrays to this language. Introduce new operators newarray,
arrayref, and arrayset that create, dereference, and update arrays.

This leads to
	ArrVal = (Ref(ExpVal))*
	ExpVal = Int + Bool + Proc + ArrVal
	DenVal = Ref(ExpVal)

Since the locations in an array are consecutive, use a representation
like the second representation of Mutable Pairs.

Running examples:

(run 
  "let a = newarray(2,-99)
      in 
        begin
            arrayset(a,1,0);
            arrayref(a,1)
        end")
(const-exp 0)

(run 
  "let a = newarray(2,-99)
      in
        begin
            arrayset(a,1,0);
            arrayref(a,1);
            arrayref(a,0)
        end")
(const-exp -99)
